### What is a source-only library?

Sometimes there are classes that are needed in several libraries, but should not be exposed to consumers of those libraries. Such classes are grouped into source-only libraries: library projects with a Cement configuration in which all classes are marked internal and no build is performed. Dependent library projects then add links to the required source files from a source-only library instead of referencing an assembly.

In case the code in a source-only library is considered useful by itself, which is almost always, the library is built and published to NuGet like a usual Vostok library.

Source-only libraries are developed in much the same way as the usual [Vostok libraries](conventions.md), so this document only covers things that are different for source-only libraries.

A [Launchpad](../launchpad/readme.md) template can be found [here](../launchpad-templates/library-source). It's package is called [Vostok.Launchpad.Templates.SourceLibrary](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vostok.Launchpad.Templates.SourceLibrary).

### Cement module requirements
* Every Cement module should have 3 configurations defined in `module.yaml`:
	* `src` where no build is performed.
	* `notests` which does not include unit tests and is a default configuration for Cement consumers.
	* `full-build` which inherits from `notests` and includes unit tests.

### Project requirements

#### Main project

* Should define symbol `MAKE_CLASSES_PUBLIC` in Release configuration.

* Cannot reference code from any other libraries.

### Code-related practices
* Every class or interface comprising library's public API must be marked internal unless the special compiler switch is set:
```
    [PublicAPI]
#if MAKE_CLASSES_PUBLIC
    public
#else
    internal
#endif
    class SampleClass
```


### Change log

* 22.08.2018: source libs cannot reference any other libs
* 20.08.2018: source libs cannot reference other source libs
* 13.08.2018: replaced sample project link with launchpad template.
